### Question 1
_data, myVar, and t0T4L-4M0UnT are the valid variable names, as they start with either a letter or underscore and do not fall under Python's reserved word list.

### Question 2
is factors in identity of the inputs when determining if they are identical. 3 is an integer while 3.0 if a float so python does not seem them as identical.

### Question 3
``` {python}

s = "DataScienceIsAWesome"
s.find("Science")
s.find("Is")

s[4:11]
s_list = list(s)
s_list.reverse()

x=0
for i in range(len(s)):
    print(s[x])
    x = x+2
    if x >= len(s):
        break
```

### Question 4
``` {python}

grades = {
    "Alice": 90,
    "Bob": 85,
    "Charlie": 80,
    "Eve": 95
}

grades["David"] = 87

grades["Alice"] = 95

del grades["Charlie"]

grades

```

### Question 5
// is floor division and rounds down the calculated dividend so the output remains as an integer. / is regular division, so outputs may not necessarily remain as integers if the result has a decimal.

``` {python}

#will have the same output
6 / 3 
6 // 3

#will have different outputs
6 / 4
6 // 4

```

### Question 6
``` {python}

names = ["Andrew", "Betty", "Charlie", "Daniel", "Edward", "Frank", "George", "Hannah", "Isaac", "Jack"]

names[0].find("A")

names_subset = []
for i in range(9):
    if names[i].find("A") != -1 or names[i].find("a") != -1:
        names_subset.append(names[i])

names_subset

```

### Question 7 
5 += (5 * (5-1)) = 25
Order of operations in python follows PEMDAS, so x-1 is calculated first, then multiplied by x, with the final output added to x.

### Question 8
``` {python}
lst = [[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]]

lst[0][1][1]
lst[1][1].pop(0)
lst[1][1].insert(0, 10)
print(lst)
```

### Question 9
```{python}

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

result = "long" if len(my_list) > 5 else "short"

result
```

### Question 10
```{python}
tup = [{x, x**3} for x in range(1,11)]
tup
```
